Let user tweet part of post automatically chosen by you. Add link to post or custom hashtags to that tweet if you want to.

== Description ==
A very simple way to add a tweet button in any place you want in the content of the post or page content, and make it easier for user to share your content.
While creating or editing a post, you can select any part of text and click a small twitter icon in editor.
The text will be automatically wrapped in [tweet][/tweet] shortcode. On the fronted, just at the end of that text a small 'tweet' button will appear.
When user will click that button, he'll be redirected to 'post tweet' page, when tweet content will be filled by the post part selected by you while editing.
In plugin options you can choose to automatically add shortened post url to that tweet, or even a custom hashtags.
The selected content is automatically truncated to fulfill Twitter restrictions (only 145 characters), and to put link and hashtags when needed.
